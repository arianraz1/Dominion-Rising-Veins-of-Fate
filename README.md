**Dominion Rising: Veins of Fate**

Dominion Rising: Veins of Fate is a strategy game based project. The player may
pick a choice option per event in the pursuit of improving their kingdom. Each
decision carries consequences as outlined in the EventManager (certain events
require other events, prevent events, force events, and influence the outcome of
events).

Note: The game is still in development — the backend is mostly complete, but the UI
and story content are ongoing.

See EventManager class for more elaborate detail.
