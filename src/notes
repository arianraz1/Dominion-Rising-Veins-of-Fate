GSON:

// Serialization turns an object into a Json, but as a string
String json = gson.toJson(user);

// Deserialization turns a json into an object from a string (updates class fields)
// Json keys -> class fields
// It returns the object of the same class you pass to it

UserSimple user = gson.fromJson(userJson, UserSimple.class);
// Gson expects corresponding Json arrays to be a collection type (lists or arrays)

// If multiple objects in Gson you can
1. Create an object of that class within the outer class and Gson will automatically initialize it
(Converting to Json) : You can initialize multiple objects, (within the outer most object in object), and Json will follow the path of the outermost object

(Converting from Json) For lists, Gson looks at the lists type and matches them to the class of that type.
